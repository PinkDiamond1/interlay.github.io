### Docs vs Specification vs Academic Paper vs Code

 - **Documentation (this document)** is aimed at anyone who is interested to learn about Interlay and Kintsugi. The in-depth guides on [Vaults](../vault/overview) and [Collators](../collator/overview) are aimined at operators of Vaults and Collators. 

 - **Specification**. We also maintain a **[200+ page specification](https://spec.interlay.io/index.html)** for internal use, audits, and formal verification. If you are a developer, researcher, hacker or simply want to learn how exactly Interlay (specifically, interBTC) - the specification is the next best resource apart from reading the [open source code](https://github.com/interlay).

- **Peer-reviewed, academic paper**. The Interlay network - specifically interBTC - is based on the XCLAIM framework, published at the reknown, peer-reviewed IT security conference [IEEE S&P](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2019/program.html). You can [read the paper here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/643.pdf) - but keep in mind that we have developed numerous improvements since the paper was first published in 2018.
