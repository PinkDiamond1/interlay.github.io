### Introduction

Interlay is a decentralized network dedicated to connecting crypto-*currencies* like Bitcoin with DeFi *platforms* like Polkadot and Ethereum. The Interlay network is hosted as a Polkadot parachain and will be connected to Cosmos, Ethereum and other major DeFi networks.

**interBTC**, Interlay's flagshipt product, is Bitcoin on any blockchain. A 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset, fully collateralized, interoperable, and censorship-resistant. 

**Kintsugi** is Interlay's canary network, an experiment with real economic value deployed on Kusama. Kintsugi and Interlay share the same code base - with the difference that Kintsugi focusses strictly on innovation and will always be ahead in terms of features.

### Docs vs Specification vs Code

 - **This documentation** is aimed at anyone who is interested to learn about Interlay and Kintsugi, users of interBTC and operators of Vaults and Collators. 

 - We also maintain a **[200+ page specification](https://spec.interlay.io/index.html)** for internal use, audits, and formal verification. If you are a developer, researcher, hacker or simply want to learn how exactly Interlay (specifically, interBTC) - the specification is the next best resource apart from reading the [open source code](https://github.com/interlay).

 - Finally, if you can code - you can also read the [open source code](https://github.com/interlay).
