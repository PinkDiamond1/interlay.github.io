# PolkaBTC

In 2016, the [Polkadot whitepaper](https://polkadot.network/PolkaDotPaper.pdf) identified secure interoperability with Bitcoin as a critical and also challenging feature. In January 2020, with the launch of Polkadot on the horizon, the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/in) commissioned [Interlay](https://www.interlay.io/) to design a trustless bridge from Bitcoin to Polkadot based on [XCLAIM](https://www.xclaim.io/) — a carefully designed, open and trustless system that guarantees the security of user’s funds.

PolkaBTC allows users to mint 1:1 Bitcoin-backed assets onto Polkadot and use these across a wide range of applications, including decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, and lending protocols.

Funded by a [Web3 Foundation grant](https://web3.foundation/grants/), the BTC-Parachain is implemented in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using [Parity](https://www.parity.io/)'s [Substrate framework](https://substrate.dev/).
