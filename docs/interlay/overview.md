### iBTC - Radically Open Bitcoin on Polkadot

Interlay's iBTC brings radically open Bitcoin to Polkadot to kickstart liquidity for parachains like Acala, Astar and Moonbeam.

**iBTC** is a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset on Polkadot, maintained by a decentralized network of collateralized Vaults. Users must only ever trust that Bitcoin and the DeFi platform they use are secure.

Head over to the [interBTC chapter](start/overview.md) of this documentation to read more about the underlying trustless and decentralized cross-chain technology (the [XCLAIM](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/643) protocol).

### INTR: Decentralized Governance

Interlay is ruled by its community from day one - via INTR, Interlay's governance token.

Read the [Tokenomics chapter](interlay/tokenomics.md) to learn about INTR's model, or read about the [Governance](interlay/governance.md) process.

### Parachain Auction and Crowdloans

Interlay is participating in the Polkadot parachain auctions to win a parachain slot. To allow to community to vote for bringing BTC to Polkadot, Interlay is running a crowdloan.

Read the [Crowdloan chapter](interlay/crowdloans.md) to learn more about the INTR distribution and the auction process and events.

**For the interested: read the [token economy primer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interlay/whitepapers/master/Interlay_Token_Economy.pdf) released by Kintsugi Labs for an in depth understanding of the Interlay tokenomics and governance models.**

### Interlay Origins

Interlay is the bridging layer that interconnects blockchains. Resulting from the research on the [XCLAIM paper](https://www.xclaim.io/), Interlay brings decentralized Bitcoin and other assets to any blockchain.
