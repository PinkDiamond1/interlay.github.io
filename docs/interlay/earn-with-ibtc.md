# Use Your iBTC

Since one of the main reasons for issuing iBTC is to use it with DeFi dApps or protocols, we have collected below some of the use cases and opportunities that you can consider.

Please note that while we are happy to surface such use cases, this is by no means financial advice. Please do your own research and inform yourself about impermanent loss and about each dApp's or protocol's policies and fees. Interlay holds no liability for 3rd party networks / services.
