# Vaults

Vaults are one of the central participants in the PolkaBTC system.
They fulfill two main tasks:

1. **Issue**: Vaults provide collateral to hold custody of BTC as part of issuing new PolkaBTC.
2. **Redeem**: Vaults facilitate the redeem process by listening for the redeem events by users on-chain and sending BTC to the user.
