## Translation Best Practices

As Interlay will likely not be able to directly check the accuracy of your translation, you will be responsible for providing as accurate of a translation as possible. We ask you to not depend on Google Translate or other similar translation services, as these are not always accurate. If your target language has distinct formal and informal pronouns, preferably use formal ones. Likewise, prefer gender neutral pronouns if your language allows it.

The documentation is a technical writing. As such, it contains a lot of jargon, such as "blockchain". If the language you are translating to has no widely adopted equivalent, it may be appropriate to use the English term. Most importantly, try to be consistent in the used terminology.
